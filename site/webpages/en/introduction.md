# Introduction

**Spine** is a tiny MVC framework freely inspired from Backbone.js. **Spine** aims to structure your code to become more readable. It provides 5 main components:

  - **Spine.Model** is used to manage a piece of data that is a literal object,
  - **Spine.Collection** is used to maanage a block of data made of an array of objects (model),
  - **Spine.View** is used to interface the **app** with web components,
  - **Spine.Router** is used to route actions from the clicked links,
  - **Spine.Radio** is used to provide a backbone communication mechanism between components,

**Spine** is intended to be used with its companion library **RView**.
